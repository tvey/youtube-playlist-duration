# YouTube Playlist Duration

Here's a small app yet useful that calculates the total duration of YouTube playlists.

As a good addition to a Chrome extension, it may go handy away from the desktop mode.

Sometimes ideas and even tools [coincide](https://github.com/sharatsachin/ytplaylist-len), but I wanted to make my version anyway.

And I just was pleased to learn it also works with **YouTube Music** playlists.

Music albums also work with a small slight improvement!

Authentication for GET requests is an API key.

More on how I dig into YouTube Data API is in the [usefulness](https://github.com/tvey/usefulness/tree/main/external_apis/youtube_data_api).
