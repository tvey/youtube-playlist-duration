# YouTube Playlist Duration

Here's a small yet useful app that calculates the total duration of any public YouTube playlist.

As a nice addition to a Chrome extension, it may go handy away from desktop.

Sometimes ideas and even tools [coincide](https://github.com/sharatsachin/ytplaylist-len), but I wanted to make my version anyway.

And I was pleased to learn it also works with **YouTube Music** albums. Tho music playlists (authored by YouTube Music) are still on the way.

More on how I dig into YouTube Data API is in the [usefulness](https://github.com/tvey/usefulness/tree/main/external_apis/youtube_data_api).
